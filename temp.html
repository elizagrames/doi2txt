        <title>How effective are on-farm mitigation measures for delivering an improved water environment? A systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Agricultural activities are estimated to contribute 70% of nitrates, 28% of phosphates and 76% of sediments measured in UK rivers. Catchments dominated by agriculture also have elevated levels of pesticides and bacterial pathogens. European member states have a policy commitment to tackle this pollution through the water framework directive. Here we report on the results of a systematic map to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of 6 on-farm mitigation measures, slurry storage, cover/catch crops, woodland creation; controlled trafficking, subsoiling and vegetated buffer strips for delivering an improved water environment in terms of a reduction in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sediment, pesticides and faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) or pathogens from faecal material. Research evidence for the effectiveness of the 6 on-farm mitigation measures for delivering an improved water environment (as detailed above) was collated using English language search terms for temperate farming systems in Europe, Canada, New Zealand and northern states of the United States of America. Searches for literature were made from online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of topic specific reviews. Recognised experts, authors and practitioners were also contacted to identify unpublished literature. Articles were screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text using predefined inclusion criteria set out in an a priori published protocol. All relevant articles were mapped in a searchable database using pre-defined coding and critically appraised for relevance and reliability. Articles reporting the same study were removed. All full text studies without confounding factors were identified and coded for in a separate searchable database. A total of 718 articles were included in the database. Buffer strips were the most commonly studied intervention followed by cover crops and slurry storage. Little evidence was found for woodland creation and sub-soiling. No studies were found for controlled trafficking on grassland. Nitrogen was most frequently measured, followed by P, sediment, pesticides and FIOs or pathogens from faecal material. The majority of the evidence collated in this map investigated the effectiveness of buffer strips and cover crops for improving water quality. This evidence was predominantly focussed on reducing N pollution. An evidence gap exists for the impact of cover/catch crops in reducing leaching of pesticides, FIOs and pathogens, and for organic forms of N and P. There was limited research investigating the effectiveness of buffer strips for reducing leaching of organic forms of N or P, or for pesticides that are currently authorised for use/commonly used in UK agriculture. Further, long term studies across different seasons with controls, pre and post water quality measurements and multiple sampling points from both field and rivers would improve the evidence base. Evidence gaps exist for woodland creation, subsoiling and controlled trafficking on grassland."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Agricultural activities are estimated to contribute 70% of nitrates, 28% of phosphates and 76% of sediments measured in UK rivers. Catchments dominated by agriculture also have elevated levels of pesticides and bacterial pathogens. European member states have a policy commitment to tackle this pollution through the water framework directive. Here we report on the results of a systematic map to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of 6 on-farm mitigation measures, slurry storage, cover/catch crops, woodland creation; controlled trafficking, subsoiling and vegetated buffer strips for delivering an improved water environment in terms of a reduction in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sediment, pesticides and faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) or pathogens from faecal material. Research evidence for the effectiveness of the 6 on-farm mitigation measures for delivering an improved water environment (as detailed above) was collated using English language search terms for temperate farming systems in Europe, Canada, New Zealand and northern states of the United States of America. Searches for literature were made from online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of topic specific reviews. Recognised experts, authors and practitioners were also contacted to identify unpublished literature. Articles were screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text using predefined inclusion criteria set out in an a priori published protocol. All relevant articles were mapped in a searchable database using pre-defined coding and critically appraised for relevance and reliability. Articles reporting the same study were removed. All full text studies without confounding factors were identified and coded for in a separate searchable database. A total of 718 articles were included in the database. Buffer strips were the most commonly studied intervention followed by cover crops and slurry storage. Little evidence was found for woodland creation and sub-soiling. No studies were found for controlled trafficking on grassland. Nitrogen was most frequently measured, followed by P, sediment, pesticides and FIOs or pathogens from faecal material. The majority of the evidence collated in this map investigated the effectiveness of buffer strips and cover crops for improving water quality. This evidence was predominantly focussed on reducing N pollution. An evidence gap exists for the impact of cover/catch crops in reducing leaching of pesticides, FIOs and pathogens, and for organic forms of N and P. There was limited research investigating the effectiveness of buffer strips for reducing leaching of organic forms of N or P, or for pesticides that are currently authorised for use/commonly used in UK agriculture. Further, long term studies across different seasons with controls, pre and post water quality measurements and multiple sampling points from both field and rivers would improve the evidence base. Evidence gaps exist for woodland creation, subsoiling and controlled trafficking on grassland."/>

Catchments dominated by agriculture also have elevated levels of pesticides and bacterial pathogens. European member states have a policy commitment to tackle this pollution through the water framework directive. Here we report on the results of a systematic map to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of 6 on-farm mitigation measures, slurry storage, cover/catch crops, woodland creation; controlled trafficking, subsoiling and vegetated buffer strips for delivering an improved water environment in terms of a reduction in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sediment, pesticides and faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) or pathogens from faecal material.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Research evidence for the effectiveness of the 6 on-farm mitigation measures for delivering an improved water environment (as detailed above) was collated using English language search terms for temperate farming systems in Europe, Canada, New Zealand and northern states of the United States of America. Searches for literature were made from online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of topic specific reviews. Recognised experts, authors and practitioners were also contacted to identify unpublished literature. Articles were screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text using predefined inclusion criteria set out in an a priori published protocol. All relevant articles were mapped in a searchable database using pre-defined coding and critically appraised for relevance and reliability. Articles reporting the same study were removed. All full text studies without confounding factors were identified and coded for in a separate searchable database.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>A total of 718 articles were included in the database. Buffer strips were the most commonly studied intervention followed by cover crops and slurry storage. Little evidence was found for woodland creation and sub-soiling. No studies were found for controlled trafficking on grassland. Nitrogen was most frequently measured, followed by P, sediment, pesticides and FIOs or pathogens from faecal material.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The majority of the evidence collated in this map investigated the effectiveness of buffer strips and cover crops for improving water quality. This evidence was predominantly focussed on reducing N pollution. An evidence gap exists for the impact of cover/catch crops in reducing leaching of pesticides, FIOs and pathogens, and for organic forms of N and P. There was limited research investigating the effectiveness of buffer strips for reducing leaching of organic forms of N or P, or for pesticides that are currently authorised for use/commonly used in UK agriculture. Further, long term studies across different seasons with controls, pre and post water quality measurements and multiple sampling points from both field and rivers would improve the evidence base. Evidence gaps exist for woodland creation, subsoiling and controlled trafficking on grassland.</p></div></div></section>

Studies of wetlands (unless wetland adjacent to buffer strip) or floodplains were excluded.</p></li><li><p>Slurry storage: Studies measuring seepage of slurry from slurry storage, studies measuring changes in counts of FIOs or pathogens over time with slurry storage (excludes changes in N or P or air pollution studies), and studies measuring the impact on water quality of the timing and amount of slurry applications. Studies of solid manure storage were excluded.</p></li><li><p>Cover/catch crops: Studies of cover/catch crops or crops grown for winter cover and effects on water quality. Winter wheat or volunteer weeds were categorised as cover/catch crops if they provided ground cover in the same manner as a traditional cover/catch crop.</p></li><li><p>Woodland creation: Studies measuring changes in water quality after afforestation of former agricultural land. Studies growing trees for biomass and testing their potential in cleaning waste water were also included, as were studies measuring the impact of crops intercropped with trees on water quality. Studies that compared water quality between different land uses (forest, urban, arable, grassland) or measured changes in soil nutrient cycling after afforestation were excluded. Woodland buffer strip studies were also excluded as they were included in the intervention buffer strips</p></li><li><p>Subsoiling: Subsoiling studies that measured water quality. Studies that measured water quality after the break up/loosening of compacted soil layers.</p></li><li><p>Controlled trafficking on grassland: Studies that measured the effect on water quality of controlled traffic on grasslands.</p></li></ul>
</li><li><p>Types of comparator: Absence of intervention or variation of intervention. Studies with a no mitigation treatment (e.g. cropped or bare ground plots) were categorised as controlled studies, whereas studies using measurements over time and space were considered to have within treatment comparative measures and are referred to in this text as with comparator.</p></li><li><p>Types of outcome: Water quality (irrespective of experimental scale) was measured by changes in the level of any form of N, P, sediment, pesticide, FIO (e.g. total coliforms, faecal coliforms, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, faecal streptococci, enterococci or clostridia species) or pathogen from faecal material (e.g. protozoan pathogens such as <i>Cryptosporidium</i> species and bacterial pathogens such as <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Campylobacter</i> species and <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i>). FIOs are used to provide an indication of pathogen presence in water. Therefore in this review studies reporting FIOs have been grouped together with studies investigating pathogens from faecal material. Studies were included that estimated water quality from soil samples, or that measured slurry leakage or changes in counts of FIOs or pathogens over time in slurry. Studies that measured inferred impacts (e.g. soil infiltration rates, crop yields, plant biomass, denitrification rates, mineralisation of soil N and pesticide drift) were excluded.</p></li><li><p>Types of study: Only studies that reported primary research investigating the effect of an intervention on water quality were considered for inclusion in the review, which therefore excluded review articles and modelling studies.</p></li></ul>

The earliest article retrieved, dated from 1950 after that date no articles were published until 1971. A substantial increase in articles was seen from the early 1990s onwards.</p><p>Of the 718 articles, 467 met our additional criteria that articles should be at full text and not report on a study already included in another article.(Where a study was reported more than once, the article with the most comprehensive information was carried forward to the next stage). These articles were used to calculate the scientific rigour of the evidence for each intervention. The 467 articles were further assessed to remove any with confounding factors resulting in 410 articles. The number of articles removed with confounding factors was similar for each intervention.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec22">Trends available in the evidence for all mitigations</h4><p>Preliminary trends were investigated using all the 718 articles. These trends remained consistent after articles were removed to meet the additional criteria. Studies often investigated multiple mitigations or outcomes or were performed in more than one country. This results in discrepancies in the total number of articles reported.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec23">Intervention type</h4><p>Buffer strips (including woodland buffers) were the most commonly reported intervention (n=364), followed by cover/catch crop (n=245). Fewer articles reported slurry storage (n=93), woodland creation (n=24) and subsoiling (n=10). No articles were found for controlled trafficking on grasslands.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec24">Geographical location</h4><p>The majority of articles originated from the northern states of the USA (n=256) and these predominantly investigated buffer strips. The remainder of the articles originated from Europe, and most were from the UK (n=80) where cover/catch crops were reported marginally more frequently than buffer strips.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec25">Study outcome</h4><p>Overall, 36 pesticides and 7 types of FIO and 4 pathogens were included in the map. Eight different forms of N, and 10 forms of P were recorded. Four forms of sediment were recorded (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0044-5#MOESM3">3</a>).</p><p>The dominant water quality outcome measured was N (n=473), followed by P (n=178) and sediment (n=165). Less research was found for pesticides (n=71) and FIOs or pathogens (n=61). Most measurements of N were recorded in buffer strip (n=209), cover/catch crop (n=203) and slurry storage (n=58) articles. Measurements of sediment were mainly reported in buffer strip articles (n=128), although a few articles discussed cover/catch crops measuring sediments derived from soil erosion (n=28). Likewise most articles that reported measurements of P were from buffer strips (n=136), with less research found for slurry storage (n=42) and cover/catch crops (n=24). Pesticides were most often recorded in buffer strip articles (n=63). Evidence for FIOs or pathogens was limited and came from articles reporting slurry storage (n=34) and buffer strips (n=32).</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec26">Study quality</h4><p>Cover/catch crop studies had the highest scientific rigour values [mean value of 6.8, standard deviation (SD) 3.1] compared to buffer strip (mean 5.9, SD 2.4) and slurry storage studies (mean 4.1, SD 3.1). These values reflected that the majority of cover/catch crop and buffer strip studies were manipulative, often controlled and fully replicated, and were of longer duration compared to slurry storage studies. Furthermore, fewer buffer strip and slurry storage studies were randomised compared to cover/catch crop studies.</p><p>Study quality was not assessed for woodland creation and subsoiling studies due to the low number of studies found.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3" id="Sec27">Buffer strips (including tree buffers)</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec28">Description of studies</h4><p>Two hundred and twenty-five buffer strip studies were included in the database after studies with confounding factors and articles reporting the same study were removed. Almost two-thirds of the studies were conducted in the USA (n=139), the rest were mostly from Europe (n=62).</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec29">Buffer strip study design</h4><p>Over half of the studies were manipulative (n=148) with the remainder mainly correlative (n=74). Approximately, half of the manipulative studies had temporal replication (n=73) and most of the rest (n=55) had times series data. The majority of the correlative studies were conducted for at least a year or longer (n=52), whereas, over a third of manipulative studies were conducted for less than a year (n=83). Very few buffer strip studies were conducted for longer than 10years (n=5).</p><p>One hundred and four studies had a control, most frequently bare ground (n=38) or of cropped/alternative vegetation (n=27). Only 1 study used a Before-After Control-Impact experiment. Studies without a control usually had a comparator (n=121), often comparing water quality at different points along the width of a buffer, starting from the inflow of water and ending at the outflow (n=82). Some controlled studies reported results in relation to inflow measurements rather than controls. Three studies measured changes in water quality over time.</p><p>Most of the studies were conducted at single sites/farms (n=129) with fewer multi-site studies (n=41), or larger scale studies at catchment, regional, country or international level (n=38). Only twenty-three studies sampled river water, which may reflect the difficulty in eliminating the impact of confounding factors in river/catchment studies. Seventy-four studies had data for all 4 seasons, and more studies were conducted in summer (n=62) than autumn (n=21) or winter (n=13). Recording of soil type was often varied or absent (n=72) but most commonly fell within the loam range (n=129).</p><p>Buffer strips were composed of either grass (n=154), trees (n=55) or a mixture of trees, grasses or shrubs (n=69). More studies recorded buffer strips composed of deciduous trees (n=80) than conifer species (n=9). Vegetation manipulation was a common experimental factor e.g. species, density, cutting (n=98). Other factors included type or amount of fertilizer applied to plots, buffer width and soil type.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec30">Outcomes measured</h4><p>One hundred and thirty-nine studies assessed the effectiveness of buffer strips for reducing N. Nitrate (n=120) and ammonium (n=46) were the most commonly measured forms of N. Nitrate was most often recorded in groundwater whilst ammonium was most often recorded in surface water (Fig.<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0044-5#Fig2">2</a>). Very few studies investigating organic forms (n=10). Measurements of groundwater/subsurface flow were more common for woodland buffer studies (n=39/52), than grass buffer studies (n=14/102). Nitrate was commonly measured in both woodland and grass buffer strips but Total N and ammonium were more often measured in grass buffers (Fig.<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0044-5#Fig3">3</a>). Ninety-four studies assessed the effectiveness of buffer strips for reducing P.

<p>Studies most often measured P in surface waters (n=50). Little research was found for P measured in subsurface (n=5) or groundwaters (n=13). This possibly reflects the properties of phosphorus, which has a low mobility in soil. Thirteen studies measured P in multiple flow paths.

However, at the field site fans of sediment deposits were observed at the edge of the buffer strip and ground monitoring wells recorded reductions in nitrate and total N on buffer strip sites (not clear for P). One explanation given for the result was that phosphate could have been stored as sediment in the river and was acting as a source for sediment bound P which, until depleted, would mask any positive effects of buffer strip implementation. Another reason cited was that water flows may have bypassed the buffer strip either through underground drainage, or vertical movement into aquifers.

Standard reporting of statistics in water related studies and submission of data with journal papers would increase the value of reported data, facilitate the reapplication of data to subsequent analyses and ensure that water quality data is not lost to science. In addition to this issue, the following key knowledge gaps were identified:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>There was very little research investigating the impact of subsoiling, controlled trafficking on grassland or woodland creation on water quality.</p></li><li><p>Few studies measured the effectiveness of interventions at catchment scale.</p></li><li><p>Further, long term studies with controls, pre and post water quality measurements and multiple sampling points from both field and rivers would improve the evidence base.</p></li><li><p>Further research investigating seasonal variations in the effectiveness of interventions, particularly buffer strips, woodland creation and cover/catch crops would also be useful.</p></li></ul>
<p>Knowledge gaps specific to the use of buffer strips</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>There was limited research investigating the effectiveness of buffer strips for reducing leaching of organic forms of N or P, or for pesticides that are currently authorised for use/commonly used in UK agriculture.</p></li><li><p>An evidence gap exists for the impact of cover/catch crops in reducing leaching of pesticides, FIOs and pathogens, and for organic forms of N and P.</p></li></ul>
<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3 c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec61">Potential systematic review topics</h4><p>Evidence in the map often had a general inconsistency in approach that would make meta-analysis challenging for some interventions, for example slurry storage and woodland creation. The evidence base for cover/catch crop and buffer strips was more comprehensive and consistent and studies were of a higher scientific rigour compared to the other interventions investigated in this map and are more likely to be suitable for meta-analysis. Potential systematic review topics for these two interventions could include:</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading u-h3" id="Sec62">Cover/catch crops</h3>
